# <"Prework Study Guide Webpage">

## Description

This study guide was created as a tool to assist me in learning and completing the preparation work before starting the Web development bootcamp.
It provides a useful space for me to organise useful information.
Creating the guide acted as a hands-on learning tool to prepare me for the bootcamp lessons ahead.
The work I did to create the prework study guide webpage has already helped me to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.


## Installation

## Usage

The webpage includes notes for each topic learned, including HTMAL, CSS, Git and Javascript. 
For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
